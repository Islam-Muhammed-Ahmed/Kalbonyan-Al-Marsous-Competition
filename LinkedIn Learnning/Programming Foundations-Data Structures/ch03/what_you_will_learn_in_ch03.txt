    2. Operations on linked lists
        a. just like an array you can add, access, delete or search.
        b. to access an item here we are not using it's index as an array here we have to follow the pointer until you find the item you want to access.
        c. the will happen with delete and search. 
    3. use linked lists in Java
    4. Use linked lists in Java
    5. Singly vs. doubly linked lists
        a. singly linked list : they only have a pointer to the next node in the list and we can go forward to the next pointer but we can't go back.
        b. doubly linked lists: here are called double because we have a next and previous pointer and we can go through the list forward or backward.
    6.Lists in other languages
        a. no built in linked lists for swift, ruby and javaScript.
