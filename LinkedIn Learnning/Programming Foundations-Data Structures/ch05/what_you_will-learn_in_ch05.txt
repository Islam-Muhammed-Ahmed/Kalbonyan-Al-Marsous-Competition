    1. What are associative arrays?
        a. collection of key-value pairs Key:Value.
        b. associative arrays rules:
            i. key-value pairs are bound together.
            ii. each key must be unique.
            iii. order isn't important. 
            iv. values are accessed with the key.
            v. values don't need to be unique.
    2. Understanding hash functions
        a. hash is data conversion process.
        b. hash inputs : characters, objects or numbers.
        c.hash functions aren't reversible they are in one way.
        e. ASCII : is a numerical representation of text characters(which mean every character has a single numerical representation).
        f. Collision : anytime two inputs produce the same hash value.
                       or when two keys have the same hash value.
    3. Understanding hash tables
        a. hash table is an implementation of the associative array abstract data structure.
    4.Using dictionaries in Python
    5. Language support for hashing
    6. Language support for hash tables
    7. Pros and cons of hash-based structures
