    1. What are arrays?
        a. arrays are some data stored in it in rows and counting in array starts with 0 index 
            or . arrays ar collection of elements, where each item is identified by an index or key.
            ex in js : numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] here to reach number 5 you write numbers[4] as we start counting from 0.
    2. Use arrays in Swift : 
        see the exercise file .
    3.Multidimensional arrays
        a. this means that an array has Multidimensional arrays in one array
            ex in js : numbers = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6],[7,8,9],10]
                to access this array number[3][1] this will execute number 5
    4. Multidimensional arrays in JavaScript .
    5. Jagged arrays (google it) : 
         a. A jagged array is an array whose elements are arrays, possibly of different sizes. 
           -A jagged array is sometimes called an "array of arrays."
        b. Jagged arrays are a special type of arrays that can be used to store rows of data of varying lengths to improve performance when working with multi-dimensional arrays  
            ex in C# : 
                int[][] jaggedArray3 =
                {
                    new int[] { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 },
                    new int[] { 0, 2, 4, 6 },
                    new int[] { 11, 22 }
                };
    6. Resizable arrays and language support.
    7. Search arrays .
    8. Sort arrays
    9. Big O notation : 
        a. Notation used to describe the performance complexity of an algorithm .
        b. different operations like inserting  accessing and Searching and different data structure.
        c. O(1)Time: 
            i. Consistent duration of algorithm execution in same time regardless of the size of the input.
            ii. Also called "Constant time".
