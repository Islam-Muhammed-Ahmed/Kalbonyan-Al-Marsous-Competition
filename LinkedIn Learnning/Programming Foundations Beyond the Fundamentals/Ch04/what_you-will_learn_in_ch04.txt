    1.Combining and manipulating strings
        a. Concatenation : when multiple strings are combined into a single string
            ex : "Allah" + "Akbar" = Allah Akbar.

    2. Finding patterns in strings 
        a. when we would want to change the content of a string in our programs?
            ans: imagine we have a form and user has to enter f.name & l.name and you want to add this data in your database 
                and you want to store this data in capitalize but user fill it in lower case here you will use string methods 
                to store it as you want.
                 ex: text = "hello" here it's in lowerCase
                    text.capitalize() will change it to = Hello.
        b. string methods (capitalize, upper, find, index(), lower(), splice(), etc...) 
    
    3. Creating regular expressions
        a. regular expression : allows you to create a description of a pattern that you want to match .
