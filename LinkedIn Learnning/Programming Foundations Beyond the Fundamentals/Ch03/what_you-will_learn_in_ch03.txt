    1.Comparing types of external code
        a. tells you as you are a developer move on more complex programs it will be tedious to solve the same problem over and over .
        b. across programming langs developer often create code to accomplish basic tasks and share it with developer community for free.
        c. this ways makes you make custom parts of your programs.
        d. he'll talk about module that built in python that contains code like variables or functions  
            ex: import testmodule
                testmodule.mult(10, 5) = 50
        e. he'll talk in brief about frameworks and library

    2.Working with a module
        a. creating your own module (awesome)
        b.https://pypi.org/ you can find millions of modules in this website

    3. Understanding libraries and frameworks
        a. both are larger collections of software tools that help developers accomplish specific tasks.
        b. library gives you tools you can use as you wish 
        c. frameworks essentially defines how you should accomplish a task as it's .(means some decisions are already made for as long as you understand how to code within the framework )
