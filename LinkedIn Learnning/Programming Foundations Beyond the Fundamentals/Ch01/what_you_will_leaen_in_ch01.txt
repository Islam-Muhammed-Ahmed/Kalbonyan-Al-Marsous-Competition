# ch01 collections :
    1. first understanding collections
        a. grouping similar items useful in programming calls Collections
            !!. helps you to group multiple items together with a single name called variable 

    2.creating simple and complex Collections
        a. List and dictionary
            ex list: cities =[  
                "Suez",
                "cairo,
                "Sohag",
                "Aswan",
            ]

            ex dictionary: food ={
                "appetizer": "hummus",
                "entree": "gyro wraps",
                "dessert": "baklava"
            }

    3. how to deal with list and dictionary (collections)
        a. concept allow you to store data to access individual data by it's index
        b. index start with (0) 
        c. to access Suez which mention in previous ex 
            ex in list: print(cities[0]) = Suez
            ex in dictionary : print(food["entree"]) = gyro wraps

    4. at the end of the ch01 he will compare collections in other langs
