    1. introduction to object-oriented programming
       a. OOP (google it):is all about creating “objects”.
            An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions.
            These variables are often referred to as properties of the object and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects
        b. attributes & properties:
            i. attributes is the data that the object has.
            ii. properties is the methods (behavior) that the object can do (functions) 
        c. creating object is known called class & this class could be inherit in all your app
    2. built in classes:
        ex: array methods, string methods 
    3.creating custom classes and objects
        the good thing of using classes is preventing permeative code .
