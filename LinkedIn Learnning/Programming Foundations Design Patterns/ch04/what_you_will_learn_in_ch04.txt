    1. Understanding the Observer pattern
        a. the Observer pattern exemplifies of loose coupling
            i. loose coupling: strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
    2. The Observer pattern defined
        a. it's a pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object change state,
            all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    3. The Observer pattern and loose coupling
        subjects:
            a. subjects and Observers are loosely coupled
            b. they interact, but have little knowledge of each other.
            c. subject knows only that the Observer implements a specific interface.
            d. subject doesn't need to know the concrete class of the observers.
        observers:
            a. the subject relies on a list of observers.
            b. observers can be added, removed, or replaced at anytime.
            c. subject doesn't care : it keeps doing it's job.
            d. any change you made to the observers never effect on the others that's true loose coupling.
