    1. Encapsulating iteration
    2. Understanding the Iterator pattern
        a. this provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
        b. aggregate objects collect object are arrays, java collection classes, like ArrayList, lists, sets, maps, and dictionaries.
    3. Using the Iterator pattern
    4. Using built-in iterators (JAVA).
        a. Java's Collections classes all come with iterators
        b. use the iterator() method to get the iterator fot any collection class, including ArrayList.
        c. java arrays don't have built-in iterators.
    5. The single responsibility principle
       - this means a class should have only one reason to change. 
        a. every responsibility increases the chance of changes
        b. two responsibilities means two areas of potential change.
        c. we want to avoid change whenever possible.
    6. The iterator pattern as language feature
        a. java's enhanced for statement, python for/in statement, and javaScript's for/of statement.
