    1. Creating chaos with inheritance
    2. Understanding the open-closed principle
        a. it's a classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
         Question: how do we design object system that adhere to the open-closed principle?
         answer: inheritance : powerful, but it can lead to inflexible designs.
                               all classes inherit all behaviors.
                 composition : we can still inherit behavior but we can do it by composing objects together.
                                we can make dynamic runtime decisions
    3. Extending behavior with composition
    4. Understanding the decorator pattern
        a. this pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
            decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
    5. Using the Decorator pattern
