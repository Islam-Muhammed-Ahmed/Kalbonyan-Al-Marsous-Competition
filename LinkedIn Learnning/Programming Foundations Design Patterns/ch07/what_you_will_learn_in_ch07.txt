    1. The need for factory patterns
        a. program to an interface not an implementation:
            -clients remain unaware of the specific types of objects they use, as long as the objects adhere to the interface that clients expect.
        b. imagine you work in pizza restaurant and every time you create pizza you will make the same code iteration but the only different is the name of it
            so in stead of making the same code every try to built a factory method to do this and call it when you need instead of repeating the code.
    2. The Factory Method pattern
        a. it's defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclass decide which class to instantiate factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclass.
    3. Using the Factory Method pattern.
