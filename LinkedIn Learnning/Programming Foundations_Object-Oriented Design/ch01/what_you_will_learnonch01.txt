    1. Object-oriented thinking:
        a. it helps to compare it with a common alternative .
    2. objects :
        a.you as a human an object ^^ & every thing  around you are considered as objects in programming
        b. but if you have 2 mugs or cubs tha doesn't they are the same object .
            ex: mug can be full, empty or somewhere in between.
        c. objects have:
            i. identity : islam's coffee mug
            ii. attributes : color,size,fullness
            iii. behaviors : fill(), empty(), clean()
        d. in oop we don't focus on the verbs as we focus the nouns  
    3. classes : is code-template for creating program objects 
        a. once you create a class you can use objects in it as you want and start to use in any place in your program
        b.methods: is basically is a func but methods are defined as they are part of class.
    4.  abstraction : 
        a. means we focus on essential qualities of something rather than one specific example. 
            ex: you have a coffee machine you only care about your cub of coffee and doesn't care about the process which the machine is doing like boiling the water, mix coffee and etc... 
          another definition abstraction shows the final result of the process.
    5. encapsulation : 
        a. means containing the element of an object. not to keep them together but to protect your data.
        b. you can only access these data by using their method.
        c.the important principle of encapsulation that an object should not make any thing about it self available except for necessary data for other apps to make it run.
    6. inheritance :(code reuse instead writing it from scratch) 
        a. base a new object or class on existing one.
        b. inherit the existing attributes and methods.
    7. polymorphism : 
        a. dynamic polymorphism : uses the same interface for methods on different types of objects.
        b. static polymorphism : it uses method  called overloading this method implement multiple methods with the same name, but different params .
    8. analysis,design and programming    
    9. unified modeling lang (UML).
