    1. creating class diagrams: Attributes
    2. creating class diagrams: Behaviors
        a. here he will tell you that you should focus what will objects do rather just doing them as data structure <3
    3. Converting class diagrams into code.
    4.Instantiating classes
        a. it's used a method called Constructor : it's a special method that gets xa;;ed to create an object .
    5. Class with multiple constructors
        a. it's good thing to have more than one constructor in our func (object) 
        b. Destructor : a special method that gets called when the object is destroyed 
        c. and langs use the garbage collection (js) use something called a finalizer rather than destructor.
    6. Static attributes and methods
        a. you can store data as instance variable :
             i. instance variable : variable for which ech instantiated object of a class has separate.
