note : i think in this chapter i don't have to write any because all it needs is to focus on every thing they talking about just stay focus with the instructors
    
    1. use cases:
        a. title: what is the goal?
        b. primary actor : who desires it?
        c. success scenario: how is it accomplish??
    2. Identifying the actors
    3. Identifying the scenarios
        ex : imagine you have a microwave you have some scenarios to go through
            1. plug into power 2. turn on power 3.enter cook time 4. press start button
    4. Diagramming use cases:
        a. use case diagram is another diagram that comes from UML.
    5. User stories :
        a. as a user(type of user) / i want to do(goal)... / so that(reason) ......
            note: you have to watch to get it.
        ex : as a photographer i've to use the camera to take some photos . here you focus on one specific goal
