    1.Unique filtering with hash table
        a. the key of hash table has to be unique.
        b. the key of hash table was exists it will be replaced.
        c. as this process each element in the list,
            and then attempt to perform an addition to the has table
            and as the number of elements grows the time complexity will grow in linear fashion
    2. Value counting with hash table
        a. as the hash table requires each key has to be unique we can implement an algorithm to count individual item.
    3.Find max value recursively
