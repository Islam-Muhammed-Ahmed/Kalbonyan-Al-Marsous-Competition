    1. Understanding recursion
        a. recursion it's s function call itself from within it's own code.
        b. recursive function need to have a breaking condition or it will goes to an infinite loop.
        c. this prevent infinite loops and eventual crashes.
        e. each time the function is called, the old arguments are saved.
        f. this is called the "call stack".
    2. Simple recursion example
    3. Power and factorial.
