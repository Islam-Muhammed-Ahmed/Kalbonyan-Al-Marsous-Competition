    1. what are algorithms ?
        a. an algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
    2. Common algorithms in programming
        a.search algorithms like finding a specific data in a structure.
        b. sorting algorithms takes a dataset and apply a sort order to it.
        c. computational algorithms given one set of data, calculate another.
        d. open exercise file.
    3. Measuring algorithm performance
        a.it's important understand how to talk about algorithm performance this's help you how to choose a particular algorithm to solve programming problem. 
        b. measure how an algorithm respond to dataset size.
        c. Big-O notation this notation format is used to describe how a particular algorithm performs as size of set input grows over time.
        d. "important" Common Big-O notation Terms:
          i. O(1)=> constant time => looking up a single element in array.
          ii. O(log n)=> logarithmic => finding an item in a sorted array with a binary search.
          iii. O(n)=> linear time => searching an unsorted array for a specific value.
          iv. O(n log n)=> long-linear => complex sorting algorithm like heap sort and merge sort.
          v. O(n²)=> quadratic => simple sorting algorithm, such as bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort.
